- When we write default import, we can put any name we want after import. Eg: we could write import Banana from './Button.js' instead and it would still provide us with the same default export (Button). In contrast, with named imports, the name has to match on both sides. Thatâ€™s why they are called NAMED imports!

- People often use default exports if the file exports only one component, and use named exports if it exports multiple components and values.

- Keeping hard-coded constant values in the code is considered a bad practice; Instead what we can do is we make a constant.js/ config.js or utils.js file and keep all those in it and use it in the project by importing from there.

- React (and other frameworks) are trying to keep UI layer and data layer in sync i.e. keeping the UI updated with the data we get; this is achieved via quick manupulation of DOM and virtual DOM.

- React Hook is just a normal JS function written for us to use directly. Most used react hooks are useState() and useEffect().

- useState is used to create state variables in our react components.
