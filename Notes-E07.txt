- In useEffect hook we can have different cases resulting into different number of times it being invoked; they are:
    - If no dependency array is there -> useEffect is called on every component render.
    - If dependency array is [] (empty) -> useEffect is called on intial render only (just once).
    - If dependency array have some dependency -> useEffect is called on intial render and then everytime the dependency gets updated.

- Never call useState hook outside of the component and never call it inside if/else or loops or any functions present in component; Always call useState at the start in the component.

- For routing purposes in our project we use react-router-dom npm package. We use createBrowserRouter (most common function) to create routes.

- Syntax: 
            const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
            {
                path: "/",
                element: <AppLayout />,
                errorElement: <Error />,
            },
            {
                path: "/about",
                element: <About />,
            },
            ]);

        - path defines the location where we will visit; which component to render goes into element; errorElement key stores the error page which is rendered when user tries to access invalid path.

- createBrowserRouter is not the only router, there are several options to choose from. Read more about it from "https://reactrouter.com/en/main".

- to render our appRouter in our project we need another function from react-router-dom which is "RouterProvider"

- Syntax:  
            root.render(<RouterProvider router={appRouter} />);
        - we pass our routes configuration (appRouter) into router prop of RouteProvider.

- Additional to these react-router-dom provides us a hook named as "useRouteError", this hook contains a lot of information related to routing error which we can use in our error handling page (Displaying useful error message for proper debugging).

- In order to load specific components while re-routing instead of rendering complete page we use something known as "Outlet". This is also from "react-router-dom" library.

- What we do is we write <Outlet /> as placeholder component where we want to render the routed element.
eg Syntax:  
            const AppLayout = () => {
            return (
                    <div className="app">
                        <Header />
                        <Outlet />    -> placeholder where routed element will be rendered.
                    </div>
                );
            };

            const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
            {
                path: "/",
                element: <AppLayout />,
                children: [
                {
                    path: "/",
                    element: <Body />,
                },
                {
                    path: "/about",
                    element: <About />,
                },
                {
                    path: "/contact",
                    element: <Contact />,
                },
                ],
                errorElement: <Error />,
            },
            ]);

        - Instead of directly giving path at start now we have "children routing". children also take same configuration as earlier, it just allows us to render components in place of <Outlet /> .

- Instead of using anchor tag (<a href="route to go">click</a>) we use <Link /> component from "react-router-dom".
Syntax: <Link to="route to go">click</Link>. (Reason in notebook notes)

- There are two types of routing in web applications:
        - Client side routing = No network call is made. eg: when we do routing with Link component.
        - Server side routing = Network call is made and webpage is fetched for route to be dispalyed. eg: when we do routing with anchor tag <a />.

- Instead of static routing we can do dynamic routing as well.
    Syntax eg:  path: "/contact" -> static routing
                path: "/restaurant/:resId" -> dynamic routing ( the colon is used to signify dynamic value like resId in this case)
    
- useParams hook from "react-router-dom" can be used to get params (similar to paramters in a function call) values passed from the parent (component from which the child component is invoked). 
    Syntax: const { destructure params here } = useParams();
