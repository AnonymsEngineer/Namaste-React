- Before starting any project first and most important thing is planning out what we need to do.(basic layout/ UI mockup)

- To pass inline css in JSX we should use {}, as we have to pass style as JS object and not normal string. eg: <div className="container" style={{backgroundColor:"red"}} >

- To pass data dynamically to our components we use PROPS (properties); As we know react components are basically JS functions only, hence props are arguments to those functions.

- Props are sent as JS objects which we can use in our comeponents.

- 'Config Driven UI' = We have written a specific UI code and when it changes depending on the Configuration/ Data coming from backend it is known as config driven UI. eg: Swiggy has different offer for different locations and the UI also changes with it.

Q. Why React throws warning to pass key in when we are looping a component (multiple occurances)?
Ans. When we have components at same level react optimizes it's render cycles by removing all the components in the container and re-render all of them; Instead if we have UNIQUE key/id assigned to each repeating comeponent react will be able to identify the changes and will render only the new changes/ newly added components rather than re-rendering all of them.  Eg : food cards on swiggy site; if key is not passed then whenever new card is added all cards will re-render but by passing UNIQUE key react can detect the change and only render the new card.

- For mapping keys/ unique id with our component we may think of using Index of the loop but that is a BAD practice and even React offical docs recommend not to do so. Read more about it on - ""

-> UNIQUE key >>>>>>> uning Index as key >>>> not using key in component.
