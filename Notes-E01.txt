Refer to App.js for better understanding

- "THE OBJECT" is used to pass attributes to the element being created. eg: { color: "red", id: "heading" }

- React.createElement gives us a JS object, i.e. heading is nothing more than a normal JS object.

- The third arguement to createElement can also be a React.createElement if we want to create a nested tag structure
   eg: React.createElement("div", {id: "parent"}, React.createElement("div", {id: "child"}, React.createElement("h1", {}, "I am H1"))) to form a structure like below:
    <div id= "parent">
        <div id= "child">
            <h1>"I am H1"</h1>
        </div>
    </div>

- If we want to create siblings in a nested tag structure we write them in array in third arguement
   eg: React.createElement("div", {id: "parent"}, React.createElement("div", {id: "child"}, [React.createElement("h1", {}, "I am H1"), React.createElement("h2", {}, "I am H2")])) to form a structure like below:
    <div id= "parent">
        <div id= "child">
            <h1>"I am H1"</h1>
            <h2>"I am H2"</h2>
        </div>
    </div>

- Render Method replaces all previous tags in the root with new arguement, It doesn't append.
